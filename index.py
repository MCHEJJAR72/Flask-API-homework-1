Step-by-Step Setup
1.	Create a Virtual Environment
o	Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
o	Create a virtual environment. For example, using venv:
python -m venv venv
o	Activate the virtual environment:
	On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
2.	Explanation of Files and Folders
o	Virtual Environment (venv/): Contains Python interpreter and packages for isolated development.
o	Main Package (main_package/):
	__init__.py: Initializes the Flask application and sets up database connections if needed.
	config.py: Stores configuration variables for the Flask app.
	routes.py: Contains main routes for the application.
	static/: Holds static files like CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.
	templates/: Stores HTML templates for rendering views.
o	Blueprints (blueprint1/, blueprint2/, etc.):
	__init__.py: Initializes the blueprint.
	routes.py: Handles routes specific to the blueprint.
	static/: Blueprint-specific static files.
	templates/: Templates specific to the blueprint.
o	run.py: Entry point for the Flask application to run the server.
3.	Setting Flask Environment Variables
You may set environment variables in your config.py file or using environment files (.env). Example:
import os

class Config:
    DEBUG = True
    SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
    # Other configurations as needed
4.	Additional Steps
o	Install Flask and any necessary packages (flask, flask-bootstrap, etc.) using pip in your virtual environment.
o	Implement Flask routes and templates according to your project requirements.
o	Style your landing page and other templates using CSS (stored in static/).
